        "guide": "You must swipe to begin the level, but if your initial move is too large, you will fail. You will not be in a position to block the initial shot. It is preferable to just tap the screen â€“ That way, you won't move much and will be able to react to the first person in the line."

        "guide": "Opponents use one of two approaches: dunks or shots. You should wait to see whether they move before attempting to stop them. It is a foul to strike an opponent when they are on the court. If you commit three fouls, you will fail the level. You can barge into a player who is in the air as often as you like. Take a moment to observe what is going on, then decide on the best course of action."

        "guide": "Boss ballers are enormous, with red energy bars over their heads. To prevent them from scoring, you must block them numerous times. Stay close to them and begin slamming into them when they're in the air. You can frequently knock them down before they've even delivered the ball."

        "guide": "Just because you're in the air doesn't mean you can't adjust your course with a swipe. You can frequently knock them down before they've even delivered the ball. Instead of just waiting and hope you land someplace beneficial, utilize these to put yourself back in a good position to stop the following shot."
